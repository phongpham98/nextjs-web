Clear and high-quality photos will help you convey your self and increase your chances of getting more quality matches. Please follow our photo guidelines below: <br/> &ensp;&ensp; - Show your face: Make sure people can see your face. Don't hide under sunglasses or cover your face with big hats.<br/> &ensp;&ensp;- Make sure you upload one full-face photo: We don't want you to be disappointed meeting people. No catfishing!<br/> &ensp;&ensp;- Be honest & keep it real: Use photos that show the current you. Don't use photos from over five years ago. Your profile pictures should look natural, clear and focused so people can get an accurate idea of who you are.<br/>&ensp;&ensp; - Don't use low-quality photos: Don't use heavily filtered images or too dark or blurry."
