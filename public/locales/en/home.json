	  "description": "Have you ever felt a longing for another half that you haven't met yet? Do you believe that there's a great love waiting for you on the horizon? <br /><br />Life is a series of colorful days, with many joys and sorrows. Sometimes we forget that we also need to be loved, cherished, and 'remembered' by someone. If we can walk through and experience this journey together, we have created meaningful connections, one of the most valuable gifts people can give each other. <br /><br />Let Fika be the bridge between you and that soulmate you've never met, so you can walk up to each other and say, 'I miss you so much!'"
